## Python & SQL in Three Sentences

Python is a high-level interpreted and object-oriented programming language. Like JavaScript, it doesn't have to be compiled before it can be executed - it runs within an interpreter that handles the conversion into machine code.

SQL (Structured Query Language) (pronounced "sequel") is the language we use to manage structured data, and communicate with relational databases.

## Getting Started

In the `py_guides` and `sql_guides` folders, you'll find topics divided into different files. This guide is not meant to be deployed.

WINTER 2023: My focus is fleshing out my notes on Python before moving on to SQL.

## Python Topics Covered

- The Very Basics
- Variables, Data, and Values
- Doing Math
- Playing with Strings
- Expressions & Loops
- Dictionaries
- Lists
- Tuples
- Objects, Classes, and OOP
- Functions
- Simple PY solutions to Popular Technical Challenges
  - Palindrome
  - Fizzbuzz
  - Fibonacci

This guide doesn't include everything to know. It is, however, a great place to start.

## Python Cheatsheet Style Guide

### CSS

There are no CSS files for the sake of simplicity. (A CSS beginner's guide is currently in the works.)

### The Code Itself

The Python guide follows [Google's Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) as closely as possible. This involves the following:

- Using `pylint` for code linting
- Using `yapf` for auto-formatting
- Including Google's setting file for Vim and `pylintrc`

### Accessibility

No Lighthouse reports were run due to lack of deployment for this guide.

### Testing

TBD

## SQL Cheatsheet Style Guide

SQL guide is forthcoming, as well as notes on accessibility and testing.

## How Can YOU Contribute?

Add any essential Python or SQL topics with examples!

## Want More Python & SQL Practice?

Many people enjoy LeetCode, but I think [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) and [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) are easier to use and include more approachable coding questions.

## Closing Credits

Thank you to my instructors at General Assembly for my first steps into Python and SQL. Also shout-out to the many helpful YouTube channels I still refer to: [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia), [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified), [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja), [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh), and [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE).
