## Python & SQL in Three Sentences

Python is a high-level interpreted and object-oriented programming language. Like JavaScript, it doesn't have to be compiled before it can be executed - it runs within an interpreter (like the Python Shell) that handles the conversion into machine code.

SQL (Structured Query Language, pronounced "sequel") is how we manage structured data and communicate with relational databases.

## Python in More Details

Via [Asabeneh's helpful "30 Days of Python" repo](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/readme.md):

"Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an open source, interpreted, objected-oriented programming language. Python was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. The name of Python programming language was derived from a British sketch comedy series, Month Python's Flying Circus. The first version was released on February 20, 1991."

## Getting Started

In the `py_guides` and `sql_guides` folders, you'll find topics divided into different files. This guide is not meant to be deployed. My focus is fleshing out my notes on Python before moving on to SQL.

Also, make sure you [first download Python](https://www.python.org/) and learn how to set up the Python Shell (instructions to come).

## Python Topics Covered

- The Very Basics (writing comments & print)
- Variables, Data, and Values
- Doing Math
- Playing with Strings
- Expressions & Loops
- Dictionaries
- Lists
- Tuples
- Objects, Classes, and OOP
- Functions
- Simple PY solutions to Popular Technical Challenges

This guide doesn't include everything to know. It is, however, a great place to start.

## Python Cheatsheet Style Guide

The Python guide follows [Google's Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) as closely as possible. This involves the following:

- Using `pylint` for code linting
- Using `yapf` for auto-formatting
- Including Google's setting file for Vim and `pylintrc`

## SQL Cheatsheet Style Guide

An SQL guide is forthcoming, as well as notes on accessibility and testing.

## Want More Python & SQL Practice?

Many people enjoy LeetCode, but I think [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) and [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) are easier to use and include more approachable coding questions.

## Closing Credits

Thank you to my instructors at General Assembly for my first steps into Python and SQL. Also shout-out to the many helpful YouTube channels I still refer to: [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia), [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified), [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja), [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh), and [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE).
